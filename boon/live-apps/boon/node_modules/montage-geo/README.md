Tests are in the `test` directory. Use `npm test` to run the tests in
NodeJS or open `test/run.html` in a browser. 

To run the tests in your browser, simply use `npm run test:jasmine`.

To run the tests using Karma use `npm run test:karma` and for continious tests run with file changes detection `npm run test:karma-dev`.
