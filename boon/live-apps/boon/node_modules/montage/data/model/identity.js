     * use something like a 32-character hex string. It must also be unique across
     * all clients that the authorization server handles. If the client ID is guessable,
     * it makes it slightly easier to craft phishing attacks against arbitrary applications.
     * Here are some examples of client IDs from services that support OAuth 2.0:

     * It is critical that developers never include their applicationCredentials in public (mobile or browser-based) apps.
     * To help developers avoid accidentally doing this, it’s best to make the client secret visually different from the ID.
     * This way when developers copy and paste the ID and secret, it is easy to recognize which is which.
     * Usually using a longer string for the secret is a good way to indicate this, or prefixing the secret with “secret” or “private”.
