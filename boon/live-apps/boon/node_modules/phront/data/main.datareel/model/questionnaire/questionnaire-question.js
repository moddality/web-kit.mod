    About Carry Forward Choices:
    Carry Forward allows you to copy specific answer choices from one question and bring them into a future question in your survey. For instance, you can first show your respondents a question that asks which products they have bought from your company in the last six months. You can then carry forward the choices they selected into the next question and ask the respondents to rank their preference from those previously selected choices only.

    We should implement this with bindings

    About Display Logic
    You can use Display Logic to create a survey that is customized to each respondent. When a specific question or answer choice pertains only to certain respondents, you can set Display Logic on it so that it shows conditionally, based on previous information. You can choose to conditionally display both questions and answer choices, allowing you to create a survey that dynamically adapts to your respondent’s answers.
