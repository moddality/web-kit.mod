select 
   c.id,
   (select row_to_json(_) from (select c.name, c.email) as _) as properties,
   c.type
from
   "Organization" as c

//Simplified with just id as a column and the json as a second one:
select c.id, (select row_to_json(_) from (select c.name, c.email) as _) from "Organization" as c

select (select row_to_json(_) from (select c.name, c.email) as _) from "Organization" as c

//Without alias:
select (select row_to_json(_) from (select id, name, email, "addressIds") as _) as rows from "Organization"

//Resulting columns returned would be named row_to_json, which we don't really care about
select (select row_to_json(_) from (select id, name, email, "addressIds") as _) from "Organization"
